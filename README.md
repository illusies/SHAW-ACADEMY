# SHAW-ACADEMY

This repository includes the practical part of the course that I started that is hosted by the Shaw Academy at https://www.upskillist.com/learner/en/course-registration/6413ad1c258dbf74823f94f5/
The final lesson 8 in module 1 guided me into creating an online grocery shopping website that only gave me practice in the html arrangements and the styling of the website using css.
